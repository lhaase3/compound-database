 * @param atomOffset – if bond is a part of a fragment, then we need to consider atoms from previous fragment.
 * source.atoms contains numbers related to fragment, but we need to count atoms related to struct. Example:
 * fragments: [{
 *   atoms: [...],
 *   bonds: [...], this bonds point to atoms in the first fragment
 * }, {
 *   atoms: [...],
 *   bonds: [...], this bonds point to atoms in the second fragment

 * When we add bonds from second fragment we need to count atoms from fragments[0].atoms.length + 1, not from zero
 * @returns newly created Bond
